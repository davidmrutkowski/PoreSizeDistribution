!1.  file containing the atom types + diameters (sigmas) of the atoms 
!2.  file containing the coordinates of the porous solid
!3.  number of cycles (N); i.e. how many total points will be attempted.
!4.  cubelete (pore) diameter in Angstroms
!5.  pore diameter increment in Angstroms (currently does nothing)
!6.  maximum probe diameter in Angstroms
!7.  length of the unit cell
!8.  unit cell angles (yz, xz, xy)
!9.  random number generator seed
!10. logical varibale: T if you want to save coordinates of the probes of specific diameter, F - no
!11. probe diameter range within which to save the coordinates (currently does nothing)
